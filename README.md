# Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assignment. Just like in the checkpoint, you will use a linked list in your implementation.

1. In the src/Stack.js file:

- Complete the `push()` method to insert a node into the stack. The method should accept an argument data that represents the data to be stored in the node. Use the provided \_Node class to create new node instances.

- Complete the `pop()` method to remove a node from a stack. The method should return the data stored in the deleted node.

2. In the src/Queue.js file:

- Complete the `enqueue()` method to insert a node into a queue. The method should accept an argument data that represents the data to be stored in the node. Use the provided \_Node class to create new node instances.

- Complete the `dequeue()` method to remove a node from a queue. The method should return the data stored in the deleted node. If the queue is already empty, then the method should return undefined.
